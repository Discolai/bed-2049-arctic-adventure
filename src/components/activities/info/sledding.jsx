        Relax in your sled while one of our experienced mushers drive you
        across the beatiful winter landscape surrounding Troms√∏. This is the ideal
        trip for taking gorgeous pictures, bringing your family or just relax comfortably.
      </p>
      <p>
        We provide you with thermal suits and boots before departure so you keep
        nice and warm. You are then assigned a guide who will take you for a 60 minute
        drive. Guest over 16 years old will be offered a chance to drive the sled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon return to our center, we will bring you to our dog yard where you can
        pet and snuggle with our alaskan huskies to your hearts desire.
