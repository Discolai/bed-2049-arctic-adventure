        We meet up at our centre where we will distribute camping equipment and assign dogs.
        Then we are off to one of the surrounding mountains. We set up camp at the top in order
        to get the best view of the midnight sun.

        After setting up camp fire up a campfire to keep ourselves warm while relax with
        the dogs in the midnight sun.
